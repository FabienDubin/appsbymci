- ‚ö° **Vite**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- üåê **Express**: A Node.js framework for building web applications.
- üóÑÔ∏è **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing data.
- ü¶† **Mongoose**: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB that provides a straightforward way to interact with the database.
- ‚ö° **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the server.
- üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **React Router**: A routing library for React applications.
- üõ†Ô∏è **ShadCN**: A popular CSS framework for building responsive web applications.
- üé® **TailwindCSS**: A popular CSS framework for building responsive web applications.
- üê≥ **Docker**: An open-source platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside containers.

## Features

- **API Endpoints**: You can access various endpoints using Axios using services. Each service corresponds to a resource in your backend (e.g., users, products). Create a new file under the src/services directory for each resource, for example: UserService.js.
- **Authentication**: User authentication is handled using JWT tokens.
- **IsPrivate Component**:Wrapper to protect pages and redirects to the login page.
- **IsAnonymous Component**: Wrapper that makes the page accessible only for non-authenticated users.
- **IsAdmin Component**: Wrapper that makes the dashboard accessible only for admin users. Admins can be defined before registration via the .env file of the server or after creation via the admin dashboard.
- **Routing**: React Router is used for routing between different pages.
- **ReCAPTCHA**: It verifies that the user is human and avoid bot intrusion.
- **Mailjet Integration**: Mailling service to send notifications to the user (basically set on the password recovery)

## Middlewares

- **JWT Token Generation**: A middleware that generates a JSON Web Token (JWT) for user authentication.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: A middleware that checks the user's role and allows access to certain resources based on their role.
- **Rate Limiting**: A middleware that limits the number of post requests per IP. You can apply this to all requests
- **Cloudinary**: A middleware that manages the updload of the profile images using Cloudinary. It should be migrated to a dedicated server on production. You can get API key, secret and name via Cloudinary dashboard

## Pages

Here id the list of the available pages. This is a starter pack to be customized on the specificities of your project.

### Sign up üìù

The signup page creates a new user. It integrates a reCAPTCHA verification to limit bot intrusion.

    <img src='./client/public/Signup.png' width="600" >
</div>

### Login üîë

Just a classic login page with a reset password button.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src='./client/public/Login.png' width="600" >
</div>

### Home üè†

A classic home page that needs to be customized according to your project

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src='./client/public/Home.png' width="600" >
</div>

### Profile üë§

The profile page of the user. Basically, the user can update its informations. Regarding the password, a button triggers a reset password email (WIP)

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src='./client/public/Profile.png' width="600" >
</div>

### Dashboard üìä

The dashboard is only accessible for the users with the "Admin" role.
Set the default admins to the server .env file to get the user role set to admin for the defined users when they register.

- **Main page** : Some example of dataviz. It needs to be plugged to the relevant data
- **User Management** : This table allows the admin to manage the registered users, create new ones and bulk import via copy-paste from Excel
- **Dashboard - Settings** : To be defined but the page is ready feel free to customize it
<div style="text-align: center;">
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-around;">
    <img src='./client/public/Dashboard.png' width="500" >
    <img src='./client/public/UserDashboard.png' width="500" >
</div>
</div>

### NotFound üöÄ

The not found page is displayed when the url doesn't exist

### NotAuthorized üîí

This page is displayed when a user tries to go to a page that is not allowed. For example, when a normal user want to go to the dashboard.

## Tests

This project includes a test suite using **Jest** and **Testing Library** (client side) and **Supertest** (server side).

### ‚úÖ Backend Tests

- **`auth.test.js`**: Tests login/signup/logout behavior and token generation.
- **`middleware.test.js`**: Tests route protections like `isAuthenticated` and `isAdmin`.
- **`user.test.js`**: Tests user-related CRUD operations and permissions.
- **`admin-role-env.test.js`**: Ensures users listed in the `ADMINS` env variable are assigned the admin role on creation.

### ‚úÖ Frontend Tests

- **`AdminAuthFlow.test.jsx`**: Tests that an admin can sign up and access the dashboard (protected by `IsAdmin`, `IsPrivate`).
- **`AuthContext.test.jsx`**: Tests authentication context logic (login, logout).
- **`Login.test.jsx` / `SignUp.test.jsx`**: Simulates user interactions with the login and signup forms.

To run all tests:

```bash
npm run test
```
